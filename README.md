"P.S. Just to clear up a few misconceptions: I am a former and I stan panzer. I'm not communist. loyal tno fan, if we're still doing team LARP, I guess. Sorry to disappoint, but I do in fact support the flaming of idlers (they have been very naughty), and I think that increasing scope a bad thing. The ST team is committing stalling. Remember that every time you hasten to their defence. Sniping is a legitimate action. Please remember that having idea guys is a bad thing, and that the pw team was not, in fact, roaring back to life. I'm not a communist, an anti-zionist, a fascist, a meanie, etc, etc, etc... whatever else people accuse me of being these days. All team members have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."<br><br>
Deprecated and replaced by a fully async, more cleanly written tracker/C2 bot that can do graphs as of 06/06/2022.<br><br>

I made this in two hours while being extremely drunk in vc a year ago and if you think I remember how it works and what it requires you'd be very mistaken<br><br>
A reminder that discum is blocking therefore whenever its doing anything the bot fucking breaks harder than a senior contrib under panzer when asked to make a custom mechanic for the mod in a week<br><br>
I unironically doubt this shit cant be used as a reference, however it worked for planet tno.<br>I feel no shame.<br>
