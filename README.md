Deprecated and replaced by a fully async, more cleanly written tracker/C2 bot that can do graphs as of 06/06/2022.<br><br>

I made this in two hours while being extremely drunk in vc a year ago and if you think I remember how it works and what it require's you'd be very mistaken<br><br>
A reminder that discum is blocking therefore whenever its doing anything the bot fucking breaks harder than a senior contrib under panzer when asked to make a custom mechanic for the mod in a week<br><br>
I unironically doubt this shit cant be used as a reference, however it worked for planet tno.<br>I feel no shame.<br>
